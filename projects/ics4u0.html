              <h1>ICS4U0: Final Project</h1>
                <p> For the final project in this course, we had to design a video game that incorporated some aspect of life during thte COVID-19 pandemic in pairs. Min and myself decided to work with each other, and while brainstorming ideas we thought of the TTC bus drivers, and trying to maintain social distancing on a bus. We came up with a puzzle/driving game in which you play the role of a public transit driver, working your regular route everyday during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the puzzle portion of the game, you must seat all the passengers in your bus, while making sure people don't sit too close to each other. There are different types of passengers, with different social distancing rules and you must place them on the grid which represents your bus. The second half of the game is a top-down driving simulator where you control the bus, and have to drive from stop to stop on a busy street.</p>
                <p> When we started this project, we tried to implement many of the different Java game engines and libraries such as LibGDX, JavaFX, LWJGL and JBox2D. However, we eventually decided against it, and to code the entirety of our game using pure java swing. Mainly because we couldn't really get them to work using Github, or cross platform from Windows to MacOSX, but also because of complexity. Using pure java allowed us to focus on making a really fun, simple, and enjoyable game and we could start coding right out of the gate. Had we choosen to use any additional libraries, we would first have to learn how to use said libraries, giving us less time to make our game. Looking back on it, I think this was the right decision, as it allowed us to added over 15 levels to our game, and make it over 45 minutes long.
                </p>
                <p> Min and I poured alot of our time into this project, and I think it was well worth it. We are both very proud of the outcome, and how the game turned out. We tried to make the game look as professional as possible, so we spent quite some time in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop desiging all the sprites and assets. Almost every single sprite was hand drawn, and the sprites we did borrow from the internet were still heavily altered to fit the theme of our game. We both play quite a bit of video games, so we tried to include many of the features that we see in the games we enjoy, including an animated main menu, music, animation that improve how the game feels, etc. To view the source code, or download and play the game click the github button at the bottom of this page.
