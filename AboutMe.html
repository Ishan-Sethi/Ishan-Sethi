                           My name is Ishan Sethi.  I am a 16 year old highschool junior in the MaCS program at William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institue (but you already knew that). I was born across the ocean in India but my parents immigrated to Toronto when I was less then a year old. While growing up, my parents pushed me to participate in many extracurricular activities, and among one of them was a LEGO Robotics, and coding camp. Since then, I developed a huge interest in Computer Science, and the world of technology. Ever since I was kid, my two favourite subjects in school had been Math, and Science, and I also really liked playing video games. This new area was a combination of everything I liked, and I got to play with Lego at the same time? It was like a dream come true! In the following years, I got a robotics club set up at my middle school, and eventually lead our school team to compete in the First Lego League.

                            Other than programming, I also picked up several other hobbies. I was always a sports fan, and I grew up playing hockey, basketball, soccer and cricket. I still watch, and keep up with the major Toronto sports teams including the Raptors, Leafs, and Blue Jays. Through playing hockey I learned to skate, and even though I stopped playing years ago, I still enjoy going to my local rink for public skating in the winter, or playing a game of pickup basketball with my friends in the summer. I also love playing music, I was part of my middle school's Strings ensemble, and in Grade 9 I was part of Mackenzie's concert band as a percussionist. Another game I love playing is chess. My grandfather taught me how to play when I was only 8 years old, and I was even apart of middle school chess team.
